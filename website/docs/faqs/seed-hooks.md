title: Do hooks run with seeds?
---

Yes! The following hooks are available:
- [pre-hooks](reference/configs/pre-hooks.md)
- [post-hooks](reference/configs/post-hooks.md)
- [on-run-start](reference/on-run-end.md)
- [on-run-end](reference/on-run-end.md)

Configure these in your `dbt_project.yml` file.
